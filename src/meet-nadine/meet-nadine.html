        <p class="explanation-container__text">I'm Nadine Joy Douds, the creator of NJD Bakery 
            (Getting clarity on the site name now, aye?), a not real company that consists of me spending 
            glorious hours puttering away in the kitchen prior to bombarding friends, family, and coworkers 
            with treats and then eliciting from them the requisite detailed feedback. All the recipes and 
            images on the site are my very own - some turning out splendidly on the first attempt and others 
            taking quite a large amount of finagling to get them right. The goal is to have a plethora of tasty 
            treats and baked goods to meet different dietary and allergy needs, all made from nutrient dense and 
            better-for-you ingredients. Is this easy? Not at all! But, figuring out healthy recipes that don't 
            taste like dust, and sharing those treats and having folks genuinely enjoy them, is one of my most 
            favorite things to do. Life gives you an allergy or food restriction. I give you a way of dealing 
            with it.<br><br>

            Iâ€™m also starting to delve into the world of software development. Everything you see on this site 
            has been built by yours truly, with help from people who are way more knowledgeable than I am about 
            design and infrastructure stuff. I thank them immensely. The site has already gone through many 
            iterations, and will continue to do so as I learn more, try out things, and add skillz to my toolset. <br><br>  
            
            If you have any questions about NJD Bakery or development, please feel free to <a href="mailto:bakery.njd@gmail.com">contact me</a>. </p>
