            ingredients, that tastes good and makes them happy, regardless of dietary restrictions. At NJD Bakery, our
            goal is to help make that easier! Choose what you would like from an array of allergen friendly products
            and we will make those for you. If you see a product you'd like to have, but its default has ingredients
            you can't eat, choose an adaptation of that product instead. Eyeballing those chocolate chip cookies but
            wish they were vegan? Just choose the vegan option when you order! Our aim is to help you and your loved
            ones eat healthy, tasty food that leaves you satisfied and feeling good. Everyone deserves happy tastebuds.</p>
